To do list for general features that need to be implemented or bugs to be fixed

CURRENTLY WORKING ON: reimplementing RecyclerViewAdapter's dataset using an AlarmGroup

make the UI look prettier
	some repeat strings don't really look nice (ex: offset strings are always plural + sound funky, exception months are shorthand and don't have an "and" between the last two exception months)
	also not recommended to use the string concatenation that we're using currently
add switches for ringtone and vibration (?) 
add slider for ringtone volume 
customizable vibrations? 
	if we do this, probably want to manage our own Vibrator instead of relying on the NotificationChannel's (can't change per alarm, is editable by user in settings)
add a settings activity (?)
use a (color) selector to make disabled alarms more obvious 
	see https://programmer.ink/think/a-detailed-explanation-of-the-use-of-selector-in-android.html
style all components
	also ensure all components of a single type all have the same style (or children of it)
some documentation for each method and field? Also make documentation less... conversational?
make snake_case and camelCase variables and stuff all consistent?
make CardViews draggable (to reorder within folders??)
	helpful Android documentation: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/drag-drop
perhaps make setter functions return a ref to the object (allow chain setting)
remove superfluous methods and unnecessary fields 
	same with styles or strings or colors or attr or dimens or...
silent exiting (+ logging) when encountering issues or raising exceptions?
could remove the isActive field in edit strings (not REALLY necessary... I think)
could probably remove a lot of ids (i.e. for the text labels)
could possibly give user choice for some color presets (like the "sandy blue" theme that it almost feels like we're going for right now)
can maybe use FlexboxLayout for alarm editor

BUGS
sometimes a duplicate alarm (same name and everything) rings right after the first one is dismissed
	seems to only happen while the main app is open
