ToDo list for more general things that need to be implemented

make the UI look prettier
	some repeat strings don't really look nice (ex: offset strings are always plural + sound funky, exception months are shorthand and don't have an "and" between the last two exception months)
add more fields to the AlarmCreator activity
add a settings activity (?)
style all components
	also ensure all components of a single type all have the same style (or children of it)
schedule alarms with AlarmManager
some documentation for each method and field? Also make documentation less... conversational?
create an activity to show the alarm when ringing 
when errors are encountered, close the app or do something ELSE besides logging the error 
save Alarms and AlarmGroups to file (and read the files later)
make snake_case and camelCase variables and stuff all consistent?
make CardViews draggable (to reorder within folders??)
	helpful Android documentation: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/drag-drop
perhaps make setter functions return a ref to the object (makes it easier to set stuff on either a named or anonymous object)
remove superfluous methods (looking at you, getters and setters) and unnecessary fields 
	same with styles or strings or colors or attr or dimens or...
perhaps make a data structure to return when traversing the listables tree (for fewer traversals?)
silent exiting (+ logging) when encountering issues or raising exceptions?
delete testing areas 
could remove the isActive field in edit strings (not REALLY necessary... I think)
could probably remove a lot of ids (i.e. for the text labels)
add functionality to the sliders on the main screen 
could possibly give user choice for some color presets (like the "sandy blue" theme that it almost feels like we're going for right now)
could possibly animate the folder opening/closing effect?
	and have to make the folder open/close in the first place...
