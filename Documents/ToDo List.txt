To do list for new features or bugs to be fixed

CURRENTLY WORKING ON: Refactoring folders

STUFF TO CHECK UP ON
The recycler view items still toggle correctly... right?


Japanese translations
Make the UI look prettier
	Some repeat strings don't really look nice (ex: offset strings are always plural + sound funky,
	months are shorthand)
		Use quantity strings
New ListableEditor features
	Customizable vibrations?
Use a (color) selector to make disabled alarms more obvious (MainActivity)
	See https://programmer.ink/think/a-detailed-explanation-of-the-use-of-selector-in-android.html
	Also for PrefActivity for dark mode override switch perhaps
Style all components
	Also ensure all components of a single type all have the same style (or children of it)
Make documentation less... conversational?
Make snake_case and camelCase variables and stuff all consistent?
Perhaps make setter functions return a ref to the object (allow chain setting)
Remove superfluous methods and unnecessary fields
	Same with styles or strings or colors or attr or dimens or...
Silent exiting (+ logging) when encountering issues or raising exceptions?
	Could also print stack trace
Make more tests
Show multiple alarms if they ring near the same time (in a notification? together with the other alarm?)
	What happens right now is that they will ring one after the other (a feature, not a bug?)
Confirm permissions haven't been revoked?
Between versions, transfer alarms list (so data isn't lost)
Fade in alarm sounds?
Perhaps the folder animation looks a bit stiff because the folder itself doesn't move
Make "offset from now" only a thing in the Editor (the alarms are ALWAYS offset from a specific time)
	Makes it so that when you're trying to edit an alarm, it will KEEP the same offset if you don't
	change the offset time
	If it's close enough (within the minute or something), shouldn't change ringTime at all (leave it exact)
Preview alarm (mostly for volume)?
Maybe could use a single ListableInfo field for ListableEditor instead of saving to multiple fields
Maybe use MaterialDatePicker and MaterialTimePicker instead...? They are both dialogs though so there might be more clicking around 
Speed up activity loading or add a loading screen

BUGS
Sometimes requires you to unlock your phone to turn off the alarm (when off)
For February 29 in particular, REPEAT_DATE_MONTHLY may fail if it's ONLY February for repeat months
	Should repeat every 4 years, with some exceptions...
	Currently it will repeat on March 1st every year (Feb 29 on the first month only)
If the date doesn't currently exist, will use an incorrect date
	Ex: trying to set an alarm (like a REPEAT_YEARLY) for Feb 29 on a non-leap year
	Doesn't check if the date exists when saving to the alarm in the first place (Alarm.ringTime)
