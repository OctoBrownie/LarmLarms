To do list for new features or bugs to be fixed

CURRENTLY WORKING ON: 

moving existing Listables around (ListableEditor) 
	could send the entire database in the intent, wouldn't be that fast though
	could send a reduced version of the database, with only folders (major problem: how do you get the folder to add it to after returning?)
make the UI look prettier
	some repeat strings don't really look nice (ex: offset strings are always plural + sound funky, exception months are shorthand and don't have an "and" between the last two exception months)
new ListableEditor features 
	switches for ringtone and vibration (?) 
	slider for ringtone volume 
	customizable vibrations? 
		if we do this, probably want to manage our own Vibrator instead of relying on the NotificationChannel's (can't change per alarm, is editable by user in settings)
add a settings activity (?)
use a (color) selector to make disabled alarms more obvious (MainActivity)
	see https://programmer.ink/think/a-detailed-explanation-of-the-use-of-selector-in-android.html
style all components
	also ensure all components of a single type all have the same style (or children of it)
some documentation for each method and field? Also make documentation less... conversational?
make snake_case and camelCase variables and stuff all consistent?
make CardViews draggable (to reorder within folders??)
	helpful Android documentation: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/drag-drop
perhaps make setter functions return a ref to the object (allow chain setting)
remove superfluous methods and unnecessary fields 
	same with styles or strings or colors or attr or dimens or...
silent exiting (+ logging) when encountering issues or raising exceptions?
	could also print stack trace
could remove the isActive field in edit strings (not REALLY necessary... I think)
could probably remove a lot of ids (i.e. for the text labels)
could possibly give user choice for some color presets (like the "sandy blue" theme that it almost feels like we're going for right now)
can maybe use FlexboxLayout for alarm editor (similar to FlowLayout in Java Swing)
	Google blog post: https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/02/build-flexible-layouts-with.html
	GitHub: https://github.com/google/flexbox-layout
could make alarm loading asynchronous, so that layout is more responsive...?
	however, when it boots up, that means that the alarm list wouldn't be loaded yet
make local tests instrumented tests instead
make more tests
add a callback to swap frags when the Alarm set transitions between being empty and filled 
could make Alarm and AlarmGroup into Parcelables
could use DiffUtil perhaps for differences between versions of lists (minimal animations)

BUGS
if you click on the buttons presented by the heads up notification (when an alarm is ringing), the new activity it calls will flash for a brief moment while it's sending the message and closing
vibration only occurs right when the alarm starts ringing (doesn't loop)
